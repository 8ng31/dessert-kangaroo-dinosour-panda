This is a team project implemented to launch a website on Digital Ocean.
Me and my team of 2 others, created a LeetCode clone.

My primary contribution was doing all the FrontEnd work. My work can be
highlighted in the public_html file.

I also created the coding problems to retrieve from the database.

I helped some on the backend with routes.
We used node.js and MongoDB for the database.
