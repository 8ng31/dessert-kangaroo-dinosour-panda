This is a team project I was appart of with 3 other people. The taks of this project was to create a clone of the game Wordle.
This project was implmented using SCRUM to guide development.

My impact:
I created the UI for the Wordle page were the game is played. I created the board and keys along with design.
I used event listeners to iterate from one column to the next.

I wrote the initial code for the board with 5 columns. I made it dynamic by using a loop to create the board columns and created
a global variable that can be changed to manipulate the size of the board.

I also created text files with 10000 words for words of length 5, 7 and 10. I did this by putting together a command on the CLI
that would iterate through the built in dictonary on my Macbook and filter out the words of my desired length.
