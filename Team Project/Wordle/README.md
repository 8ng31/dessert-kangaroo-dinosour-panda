This is a team project I was apart of with 3 other people. The tasks of this project was to create a GUI of the game Wordle using JavaFX library. This project was implmented using Java and eclipse IDE. The project development was managed and tracked using Scrum framework, incorperating, sprint planning, and daily stand-ups to ensure iterative progress.

My impact: 
I created the UI for the Wordle page were the game is played. I created the board and keys along with design. I used event listeners to iterate from one column to the next.

I wrote the initial code for the board with 5 columns. I made it dynamic by using a loop to create the board columns and created a global variable that can be changed to manipulate the size of the board.

I also created text files with 10000 words for words of length 5, 7 and 10. I did this by putting together a command on the CLI that would iterate through the built in dictonary on my Macbook and filter out the words of my desired length.
