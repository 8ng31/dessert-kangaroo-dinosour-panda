# Operating System Simulation by creating a library of functions
## All phases used an implemented Q

phase 1 - Created structure process and a data structure to hold these processs. Process run through a system called a dispatcher, that chooses which process
take up cpu based on priority.

phase 2 - Implemented a Mailbox structure that handles interprocess communication to simulate message passing.

phase 3 - Created syscall functions for user to call kernal

phase 4 - Created deamon process to maintian disk, terminal, and clock devices. Implemented buffers to handle incoming data to devices.
